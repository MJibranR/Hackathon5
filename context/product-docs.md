# NovaSaaS Product Documentation

NovaSaaS is a comprehensive project management tool. Below are the key features and functionalities.

## 1. Dynamic Kanban Boards
Visualize your workflow with customizable Kanban boards. Drag and drop tasks between columns, set WIP (Work In Progress) limits, and track progress at a glance.

## 2. AI-Powered Smart Scheduling
The "Nova Scheduler" automatically suggests optimal task dates based on team availability, project deadlines, and historical velocity.

## 3. Resource Management
Track team workload and prevent burnout. The Resource View shows who is over-allocated and allows for easy re-assignment of tasks.

## 4. Multi-Level Task Dependencies
Create complex project structures with parent-child tasks and dependencies (Finish-to-Start, Start-to-Start, etc.).

## 5. Real-Time Collaboration & Chat
Every task has a dedicated comment thread. Use @mentions to notify teammates and share files directly within the task view.

## 6. Custom Workflows & Automations
Build "if-this-then-that" rules to automate repetitive tasks. For example: "When a task moves to 'Done', notify the QA manager on Slack."

## 7. Time Tracking & Invoicing
Built-in timer for tasks. Generate professional invoices based on billable hours and send them directly to clients.

## 8. Robust Reporting & Dashboards
Create custom dashboards with widgets for Burndown Charts, Cumulative Flow Diagrams, and Team Velocity.

## 9. Integration Marketplace
Connect NovaSaaS with over 200+ tools, including GitHub, Jira, Slack, Google Drive, and Microsoft Teams.

## 10. Document Hub (Wiki)
Create and store project documentation, meeting notes, and SOPs directly within NovaSaaS using our rich-text editor.

## 11. Mobile App (iOS & Android)
Stay productive on the go with full-featured mobile applications that support offline mode and push notifications.

## 12. Enterprise-Grade Security
SSO (SAML), 2FA, data encryption at rest and in transit, and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to keep your data safe.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
- **Login Failures:** Ensure you are using the correct email and that your password hasn't expired. Check for 2FA prompts.
- **Integration Errors:** Verify that the third-party app has the necessary permissions. Re-authenticate the integration if needed.
- **Billing Questions:** Access the 'Billing' tab in Workspace Settings to update credit card info or download invoices.
